# LIB MATHEMATICA


A simple c++ math library that allows calculations and the graphing and visualization of data.
Being built using C++ and Qt


## How to use

1. Clone repo

2. Open terminal and run the following commands

    make sure to have cmake install or set up
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./app
    ```
